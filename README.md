# EEG Reward-Punishment Analysis

This project analyzes EEG signals from healthy and depressed participants during a reinforcement-learning task.
It includes preprocessing, ERP computation, and time-frequency analysis of brain responses to reward and punishment.
The goal is to explore neural differences in feedback processing between the two groups.
Implemented in MATLAB and Python using MNE and signal-processing toolboxes.
Data visualization includes ERPs, spectral power, and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP).
